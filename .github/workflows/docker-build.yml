> After pasting each file click **Commit changes** → **Commit directly to main**

### **Step 3 — Get Your Docker Hub Token**
1. Go to [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com) → log in
2. Click your **profile icon** top right → **Account Settings**
3. Left sidebar → **Security**
4. Click **New Access Token**
5. Description: `github-actions` → Permission: `Read, Write, Delete`
6. Click **Generate** → **copy the token** shown (e.g. `dckr_pat_xxxxxx`)

---

### **Step 4 — Add Secrets to GitHub**
1. Go back to your GitHub repo
2. Click **Settings** (top tab of the repo)
3. Left sidebar → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret** — add these **one at a time:**

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` | your Docker Hub username |
| `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` | the `dckr_pat_xxxxxx` token you copied |

---

### **Step 5 — Trigger the Workflow**
The workflow already ran when you committed the files in Step 2. To check it:

1. Go to your repo → click **Actions** tab
2. You'll see a workflow run listed
3. Click it → watch the steps run live (green = pass ✅)

If it's already done, skip to Step 6.

---

### **Step 6 — Download Your Artifact**
1. In the **Actions** tab → click the latest run
2. Scroll to the bottom → **Artifacts** section
3. Click **app-output** to download the zip
4. Unzip it → open `output.txt` → you'll see:
```
Hello from Docker + GitHub Actions!
```

---

### **That's the full flow:**
```
Your Code (GitHub) → GitHub Actions triggers → Logs into Docker Hub
→ Builds image → Runs container → Saves output → Downloads as Artifact
